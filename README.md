# UPDRS-Motion-Analysis

A machine-learning pipeline for analysing motor tasks from the Unified Parkinson‚Äôs Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS Part III).  
This project extracts 3D joint rotations from videos using pose/SMPL pipelines, generates time-series motion features, and produces outputs such as Excel reports, annotated videos, and automated insights.

---

## Features

- Joint rotation extraction using HybrIK-X / SMPLX pipelines.  
- Time-series generation and visualisation of joint angles and motion features.  
- Demo script to run end-to-end analysis on input videos.  
- Example outputs included (Excel file, processed video, Gemini-style API response).  

---

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnamitraBhattacharyya/UPDRS-Motion-Analysis.git
   cd UPDRS-Motion-Analysis
````

2. **Set up Python environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate      # Linux / macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate.bat     # Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -U pip
   pip install numpy pandas openpyxl matplotlib opencv-python torch torchvision
   ```

---

## Example Usage

Process a sample video and generate outputs:

```bash
python demo_video_x.py --video-name Camera4.mp4 --out-dir results --save-pk --save-img
```

This will:

* Extract pose and joint rotations,
* Save processed frames and features,
* Export results into Excel/CSV,
* Generate an annotated result video.

---

## Repository Structure

* `demo_video_x.py` ‚Äî main demo script for running motion analysis.
* `gemini-respone2.md` ‚Äî example clinical-style response generated via API integration.
* `output_excel.xlsx` ‚Äî sample Excel output with motion features.
* `res_dance.mp4` ‚Äî example processed result video.
* `TULIP.json` ‚Äî supporting configuration/metadata file.

---

## How It Works

1. **Video Input** ‚Üí User provides a motor task video (e.g., gait, tapping).
2. **Pose Estimation** ‚Üí Frames are processed with HybrIK-X / SMPLX to obtain 3D body parameters.
3. **Feature Extraction** ‚Üí Joint rotations are converted into clinical motion features (angles, velocities, tremor metrics).
4. **Output Generation** ‚Üí Results exported to Excel/CSV, plotted as time series, and combined into an annotated video.
5. **Automated Insights** ‚Üí Example Gemini integration shows how features can be translated into clinical-style observations.

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* PyTorch (with CUDA/cuDNN if GPU is available)
* OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
* NumPy, pandas, openpyxl, matplotlib
* HybrIK / SMPLX dependencies and model weights (download separately)

---

## Notes

* Example outputs (`output_excel.xlsx`, `res_dance.mp4`) are provided in the repository.
* Model weights for HybrIK/SMPLX are **not** included due to size ‚Äî follow official instructions to download and place them locally.
* For reproducibility, you can create a `requirements.txt` using your working environment.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!
Suggestions include:

* Adding a `requirements.txt` for exact versions,
* Including notebooks for exploratory analysis,
* Expanding the API integration for automated reports.

Would you like me to also **auto-generate a `requirements.txt`** based on the scripts in your repo so people can `pip install -r requirements.txt` right away?
